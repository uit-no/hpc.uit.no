## About the group

We are part of the [Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services

We have in-house expertise in operating clusters and networks with hundreds of
nodes, thousands of cores, and petabytes of data.  We have experts in software
installation, code performance optimization, CPU and GPU programming, and
