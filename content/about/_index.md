# About us

On this page we summarize what we do more long-term. We also have a page about
our [projects](@/projects.md).

## Team

[See the people working for the HPC group.](/about/team/)


## Hardware

One of the NRIS supercomputers, [Fram](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/fram.html#fram), is located at UiT. Fram is a
supercomputer with over 1000 individual nodes, each with 32 cores, capable of
1.1 PFLOP/s. A large portion of our job is to make sure that this machine
operates at peak capacity. This involces typically replacing failing components,
rebooting machines that has stopped working, and upgrade or replace parts of
the machine when new capabilities or improved performance is available.


## Software

- **GPU for HPC**:
  Our team is dedicated to enhancing GPU usage for both NVIDIA (Saga and Betzy) and AMD (LUMI-G) GPUs.
  Part of our duties involves crafting comprehensive tutorials that facilitate understanding and optimal
  utilization of both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. We also actively participate in, and organize, training events
  with the aim of fostering GPU operation skills among users. Furthermore, we provide consistent user support,
  helping users navigate the complexities and solve any issues they may encounter in GPU usage.
- **Research software engineering**:
  Within the [research software engineering group at UiT](https://research-software.uit.no),
  we interact closely with users to facilitate their software development process. Our services range from
  assisting in enhancing your scripts or code, to helping in organizing your code for optimal efficiency.
  We also provide guidance on how to effectively share your code with others. Additionally, we offer support
  aimed at improving the performance of your code to ensure it runs faster and more efficiently.
- **Software team**: We contribute to software installations for NRIS clusters.
  We use [EasyBuild](https://docs.easybuild.io) as the main software installation management tool. 
- **Internal tooling**:
  We develop internal tools for HPC systems that improve the user and support experience:
  * [dusage](https://github.com/NordicHPC/dusage/) shows storage quota and usage on the national HPC systems
  * [sonar](https://github.com/NordicHPC/sonar/) collects data on jobs resource usage
  * [jobgraph](https://github.com/NordicHPC/jobgraph/) uses data from sonar and plots info from jobs


## Outreach and on-boarding

- We help new users getting started through the
  [small scale exploratory work projects](https://www.sigma2.no/service/small-scale-exploratory-work-ssew).
- On [this page](@/accounts.md) we describe how you can get access to a test
  account or a course account.
- We are planning to start later this year with regular (weekly) office hours
  to provide a contact point to discuss ideas and issues with user communities.


## Training

With other NRIS centers and international collaborations we develop and deliver courses and training events:
- [NRIS training portal](https://documentation.sigma2.no/training/events.html)
- [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/)


## Support

- We provide support for NRIS users and improving usability. 
- We help new users getting started through the [small scale exploratory work projects](https://www.sigma2.no/service/small-scale-exploratory-work-ssew)
- Extended user support (support that requires few days of work)
- Advanced user support (support that requires few weeks of work)
- Improving the [documentation](https://documentation.sigma2.no/)
- Improving internal policies to make things easier for users
