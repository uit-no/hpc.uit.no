# Training and events

Most courses we do are developed and organized together with
[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) and
[NRIS](https://documentation.sigma2.no/).

You can also join our [email newsletter](@/contact.md) to stay up-to-date about
courses and events.


## Upcoming events and courses we recommend

- In September we will contribute to a [CodeRefinery
  workshop](https://coderefinery.org/workshops/upcoming/). We have written a
  [blog post](https://coderefinery.org/blog/2023/06/25/planning-sep-workshop/)
  where we summarize planned improvements.
- [Meet the HPC group October 3](@/events/outreach2023.md). We invite users and potential users to an informal meeting with pizza and talks on good practices using our resources. 
- [HPC on-boarding
  course](https://documentation.sigma2.no/training/events/2023-10-hpc-on-boarding.html)
  for new users on Saga, Fram and Betzy. 3.-5. October, online.
- [FAIR Data Visualisation](https://uit.no/tavla/artikkel/823818/fair_data_visualisation), October 17 - 19 and 23, Tromsø Breivika campus.
